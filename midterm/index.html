          <!-- <h2> Aerospace </h2> -->
          <p>I've been fascinated by space and space-exploration since I was a kid - much like most kids. 
          There's a really cool YouTube channel called "bps.space", and it teaches you how to design and 
          build model rockets, including all of the systems onboard, launch and land them. It's been a 
        dream of mine to do so myself. Luckily, I was able to join the Rogue Aerospace VIP this semester, 
      and my team and I have begun the process of designing our own low power rocket. </p>

          <!-- <h2>Fashion</h2> -->
          <p>I have a lot of fashionable people in my family - designer, models, public figures. Therefore, I grew up seeing very elegant and fashionable people around me. I wanted to be a part of that world, as a designer first, then as a model because of the theatrics.</p>

          <!-- <h2>Old Computerized Systems</h2> -->
          <p>There's a game library on the 6th floor here, with the game center, and that has become my favorite place. They have all kinds of consoles and computers dating back to the 80s. It is amazing. I want to use them all and understand how they work inside out.</p>

          <!-- <h2>Computer Security</h2> -->
          <p>Knowing how a piece of software, an operating system, or even just a program works from the ground up is very appealing to me. Imagine being able to become what is essentially a computer doctor!? Diagnosing vulnerablilities and not only patching but fixing them... what a bautiful thing. Joining the OSIRIS lab at NYU has become one of my dreams. </p>

          <!-- <h2>Cuisine</h2> -->
          <p>Food is extremely important to me, it represents shared moments with those most important to me. My grandmother is basically a chef, and had she practiced, she would have been a Michellin-star chef. I have always admired the loving yet focused and diligent manner in which she cooks and the professional way in which her kitchen operates. The quality and flavour of the food remains unmatched (I have dined at some of the best restaurants, and they do not top her food hehe!) </p>

          <p>I used to edit little movies on iMovie as a kid, and have always found a lot of job in making and viewing moving pictures - movies, short-films, animation, videos in general. I love the storytelling and the emotions they can you feel.</p>

          <p>Animation has been ever-present in my life, and always had such a strong impact on me. From Disney classics, to Ghibli classics, as well as TV shows like Naruto, One Piece, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the works of the greats like Satoshi Kon. And soo much more. The impact they have had on my life will make me ever grateful to animation. I really want to learn to draw, do 2D and 3D animation and games, as well as motion graphics. </p>

          <p>Games are worlds you get to immerse yourself in for hours; they also allow you to learn, and grow, and depend on yourself. I cannot express the magic I find them. I cry, laugh, wonder, and wander for hours and hours, getting more immersed than I could ever image being. </p>
